# 6.7830 Project: Exploring the Scalability of MCMC Methods for Discrete Distributions

This repository contains code for reproducing the main results of the paper
**"Oops I Took A Gradient: Scalable Sampling for Discrete Distributions"**
by William Grathwohl et al. (2021), adapted from https://github.com/wgrathwohl/GWG_release.
The paper proposes **Gibbs-With-Gradients (GWG)**,
an efficient MCMC algorithm that incorporates gradient information to improve sampling for discrete distributions.

I evaluate GWG on three discrete probabilistic models:  
- **Ising Model**
- **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)**
- **Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM)**

## Reproducing Results

1. **Run Experiments** (generates `.pkl` files under `save/`)
   - [`ising.ipynb`](ising.ipynb) — Ising model experiments
   - [`rbm.ipynb`](rbm.ipynb) — RBM experiments with Gibbs-like samplers
   - [`rbm_relax.ipynb`](rbm_relax.ipynb) — RBM experiments with continuous relaxations (R-HMC, R-MALA, D-SVGD)
   - [`fhmm.ipynb`](fhmm.ipynb) — FHMM experiments

2. **Plot Figures (numbering matching the GWG paper)** (reads from `save/` directory)
   - [`figure2.ipynb`](figure2.ipynb)
   - [`figure3.ipynb`](figure3.ipynb)
   - [`figure4.ipynb`](figure4.ipynb)
   - [`figure5.ipynb`](figure5.ipynb)

Note that full `.pkl` files necessary for creating the Ising model animations were too large to upload to GitHub and are thus not included in the `save/` folder here.

## Video Visualizations

Below are animated GIFs showing sampler behavior on the Ising model and RBM.
